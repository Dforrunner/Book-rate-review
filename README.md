Book Rate and Review App.
This is simple project I'm working on to learn Flask. 

Current functionalities of the site are: 
 - Search books by title, author, isbn, and year
 - User accounts:
    - Sing in
    - Sign up
    - Add books to bookshelf
    - Remove books from bookshelf
    - Change username
    - Change password 
    - Delete account
    
Rate and review functionalities aren't implemented by me yet, but you can still leave a rating and a review via
Goodreads API. I am using Goodreads Api for all the book reviews and stats. 

For book cover images I am getting them from the following APIs:   
    - Link to LibraryThing cover API: https://blog.librarything.com/main/2008/08/a-million-free-covers-from-librarything/
    - Link to Open Covers API Docs: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers 

I will be moving onto another project at this point, but will be revisiting this one to implement tests and apply some
of my new knowledge that I hope to gain from the future projects.
